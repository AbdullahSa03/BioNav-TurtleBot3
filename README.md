## Overview
This project implements a biologically inspired visual navigation system that mimics mammalian spatial representation. It uses:

- Visual feature extraction
- Head direction and place cell encoding
- Associative learning for sensorimotor control

The system is designed for TurtleBot3 with a Raspberry Pi and LiDAR for real-time navigation.

---

## Features
- Vision-based feature extraction
- Head direction and place cell-based localization
- Adaptive navigation using learning rules
- Supports exploration and navigation modes

---

## Status
Work in progress. Partial implementation tested on TurtleBot3.
